# HubSpot Toolkit

HubSpot tools for Starter/Free plans — skills, automations, and utilities that bring enterprise features to every HubSpot tier.

## Skills

### hubspot-ab-test-lists

A/B (and A/B/C/…) split test lists for HubSpot email campaigns — no Marketing Hub Professional required.

Takes your contact list, filters for eligible marketing contacts, randomizes them into equal groups, and produces import-ready CSV files for HubSpot static segments. Works with any number of email variants.

**Install:**

```bash
npx skills add forci/hubspot-toolkit@hubspot-ab-test-lists
```

**Triggers on:** "split test", "A/B test emails", "create test segments", "randomize contacts for email test"
